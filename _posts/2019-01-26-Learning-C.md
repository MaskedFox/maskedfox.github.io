# Learning C from the Computer Science PoV

#### I few months ago i decided that in order to understand how to Reverse Engineering i really needed to Learn C.

#### and have a solid Foundation on it. After a long period of researching Books and classes online i decided to start this course from EDX called "C Programming with Linux" by the Dartmouth university and Institut Mines-Telecom.
