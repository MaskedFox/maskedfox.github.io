## Goals
- Goal #1: Finish `Learn C the Hard Way (LCTHW)` (up to exersice 31, 41, 45, 48 and 52)
- Goal #2: Finish all exercises from `h0mbre's Creating a Rootkit to learn C`
- Goal #3: Finish `pwn.college`
  - I might not finish it this year, but at least i want to finish NX and ASLR part and exercises.

So its been a while, but to keep myself accountable im going to expose myself to the internet =s

The idea here is log the time im commiting myself to learn C programming to do a better job and to advance my skills. I would like to get to the exercise 31 in the book `Learn C the Hard Way` in the next 3 weeks and move on to [h0mbre's Creating a Rootkit to learn C](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C) and finally start [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) w the help of You and Discord =p (Today is 05/18/2021).

At the bottom i will also write all the things im learning in 2021, again to keep myself accountable, but also to celebrate all the things i learned this year.
